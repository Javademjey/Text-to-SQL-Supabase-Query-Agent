# Text-to-SQL-Supabase-Query-Agent
This project implements an intelligent Text-to-SQL Agent capable of converting natural language user requests into executable PostgreSQL queries. It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, LangGraph for agent orchestration, and connects securely to a Supabase database to fetch and display real-time analytics.
